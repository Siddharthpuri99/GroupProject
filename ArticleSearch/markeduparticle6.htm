<p>U.S. Edition</p><p>By Stephen Collinson, CNN</p><p></p><p>Updated 11:15 AM ET, Fri March 6, 2015</p><p>Washington (CNN)Hillary Clinton's biggest challenge to a smooth launch of her 2016 campaign is a familiar one: Herself.</p><p>At the very least, the <mark>controversy</mark> over her exclusive use of personal -- instead of official -- email while Secretary of State threatens to further <mark>complicate</mark> her expected 2016 White House candidacy. The news is all the more challenging for Clinton after stinging <mark>criticism</mark> of foreign donations to her family's <mark>philanthropic</mark> foundation and her comments about her personal wealth.</p><p>But the email saga -- complete with echoes of scandals from the 1990s -- is perhaps the starkest reminder yet of the <mark>daunting</mark> risk Democrats are taking. The party is heading into a presidential campaign with a likely candidate who is a world figure with a proven domestic appeal -- see the 18 million <mark>primary</mark> votes she snagged in 2008 -- but who also has significant political vulnerabilities.</p><p>Clinton's stuttering last few months represent the kind of rough political patch that a strong Democratic <mark>primary</mark> opponent could exploit.</p><p>But Clinton's grip on the Democratic Party is so strong that no leading power broker is <mark>criticizing</mark> her, in the knowledge that the party lacks any other heavy-hitters for 2016. There is certainly no one with the star power or <mark>clout</mark> to capitalize on Clinton's troubles like Barack Obama did so successfully in 2008.</p><p></p><p></p><p>"I don't see there is any <mark>credible</mark> challenger," said one Democratic strategist, voicing the private belief of many in the party.</p><p>READ: Clinton asks State to release emails</p><p>While Sen. Elizabeth Warren is a rock star for the Democratic grass roots for her populist anti-Wall Street <mark>rhetoric</mark>, few in the party see her as a strong potential general election candidate. Vice President Joe Biden is <mark>biding</mark> his time and is beloved among Democrats, but would be an extreme long shot to beat Clinton. Another possible runner, former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley, polls lower than the margin of error in early surveys of the race.</p><p></p><p>It is <mark>testimony</mark> to the power of Hillary and Bill Clinton among Democrats that there are few <mark>prominent</mark> party figures willing to go on the record to voice doubts about the former secretary of state. It may also be a sign that key party figures realize that while Clinton may have flaws, she represents the only <mark>realistic</mark> chance of the party pulling off the rare feat of winning three presidential elections in a row.</p><p>But if there is no Democrat to take her down, Republicans believe that the email saga is another chance to severely weaken Clinton.</p><p>They say the <mark>quest</mark>ion of Clinton's emails may <mark>reverberate</mark> deep into the campaign, because it fits a critical <mark>narrative</mark> that the Clinton way of politics is underhanded and often skirts the rules. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have the power to take the drama in unexpected directions as -- armed with <mark>subpoenas</mark> -- they plow through pages of turned over documents.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Though Clinton's defenders insist she did nothing "<mark>nefarious</mark>," and say she turned over 55,000 emails to the State Department last year, Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said Clinton set up a "homebrewed" server system to "skirt" federal transparency regulations for top officials.</p><p>Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist who worked for Mitt Romney's presidential campaigns, said the <mark>controversy</mark> would help the eventual GOP nominee build a case against Clinton.</p><p>"It may look like it is an transparency issue right now, but the bigger problem for the Clinton campaign is that this is going to morph into a character issue for Hillary Clinton," Madden said.</p><p>Republicans demands that more emails be turned over could also fuel other efforts by Clinton's foes on Capitol Hill, including those running the <mark>probe</mark> into the murder of U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, while she was secretary of state.</p><p>READ: Stumbles fuel Clinton's Dem critics</p><p>All of this, combined with the lack of any clear sense as to the values and themes that are <mark>compelling</mark> a new Clinton campaign -- other than a historic <mark>quest</mark> to be the first woman president -- is contributing to a sense of uncertainty around her prospective White House effort.</p><p>"A <mark>crucial</mark> part of a campaign of a successful campaign roll out is <mark>momentum</mark>," said Madden. "This reminds the public of Clinton hangovers they had .... or every scandal that has been litigated. It is just drama after drama with them."</p><p></p><p></p><p>Privately, some Democrats are getting nervous that the kind of <mark>disarray</mark> that helped pull Clinton's 2008 campaign apart might be resurfacing -- even as others argue this is very much an <mark>arcane</mark> Beltway storm that is unlikely to trouble heartland voters.</p><p>Some are asking how a <mark>politician</mark> who has been as <mark>thoroughly</mark> investigated as Clinton, and who knew she might run for president again, would ever make a decision to sidestep official State Department email accounts.</p><p>And if it turns out the server Clinton set up to handle her email at her New York home was not sufficiently secure, the episode could take a much more serious turn and threaten her ability to argue that she's strong on national security.</p><p>Still, the email episode seems well down the list of blockbuster scandals the Clintons have survived -- so it's possible its impact could turn out to be <mark>peripheral</mark> to her political ambitions.</p><p></p><p>If so, it would mark the latest twist in an extraordinary tale of missteps and <mark>redemption</mark> that the Clintons have lived on repeat for much of their 40 years in politics.</p><p>Tracy Sefl, a senior advisor for the group "Ready for Hillary," detected no great concern about the email flap among elected officials at an "Emily's List" dinner headlined by Clinton this week.</p><p>"Each of them said with great <mark>conviction</mark> that their <mark>constituents</mark> could not care less about this," Sefl said. "Rather, their same <mark>constituents</mark> prefer to hear her ideas about issues that affect their lives. Yes, it's a familiar <mark>refrain</mark>, but that's because it remains true."</p><p>Both Clintons have long records of turning the heat of a political <mark>controversy</mark> away -- by showing that they are working hard for <mark>vulnerable</mark> middle class Americans who care little for Beltway scandal.</p><p>But Hillary Clinton is handicapped right now because she is not a declared candidate. She can't just get out on the stump and change the conversation or surround herself with loving crowds.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Some Democrats believe the last few days show the downside of Clinton's <mark>strategy</mark> not to jump into the race early, even though she lacks a serious <mark>primary</mark> opponent.</p><p>With this in mind, her late-night Tweet on Wednesday revealing that she had asked the State Department to reveal the content of her emails, only contributed to a feeling that she is dodging direct <mark>quest</mark>ions.</p><p>The White House, meanwhile, is in a tough spot as the row over Clinton emails becomes the latest point of tension in the long psychodrama between President Barack Obama and the Clintons.</p><p>It might not have been about Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate or Monica Lewinsky but White House spokesman Josh Earnest got a small taste this week of what his 1990s <mark>predecessors</mark> like Mike McCurry faced when he was pummelled with <mark>quest</mark>ions about an <mark>alleged</mark> Clinton scandal.</p><p>Earnest's uncomfortable replies, in which he <mark>cited</mark> State Department procedures for the archiving of official email, appeared to be an attempt to insulate the White House from scandal while avoiding pitching the woman who is the best hope of <mark>preserving</mark> Obama's <mark>legacy</mark> deeper into the mire.</p><p>It's was an especi<mark>ally</mark> <mark>ironic</mark> moment, because Obama often implicitly <mark>invoked</mark> the Clinton wars to <mark>justify</mark> his push for a new kind of politics during his 2008 campaign.</p><p>A longtime Clinton <mark>ally</mark> admitted that there is an understanding in her camp now that the current flap could continue to fester.</p><p>"There is a sense among her <mark>allies</mark> that this story is <mark>complicate</mark>d, and that it won't go away any time soon," the person said. "It won't matter in the end, given what a known quantity she already is across the political <mark>spectrum</mark>, but it will nonetheless linger."</p><p></p><p>U.S. Edition</p>
